# Return Policy

We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.

To be eligible for a return, you'll need the receipt or proof of purchase.

If returning digital software, you must immediately discontinue use of the software and delete all downloaded copies of the software.

To start a return, you can contact us at _sales@feathersui.com_. You can always contact us for any questions about returns, exchanges, or refunds at the same e-mail address.

## Bugs and Issues

Please inspect your order upon receipt and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so that we may evaluate the issue and make it right.

Certain types of items cannot be returned, like custom products (such as special orders or personalized items). Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.

Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.

## Exchanges

The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.

## European Union 3 day cooling off period

Notwithstanding the above, if merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within 3 days for any reason and without justification. As above, if the item is digital software, you must discontinue use of the software and delete all copies of the software. You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

## Refunds

We will notify you once we've confirmed that your item is eligible for return to let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you'll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.

If more than 15 business days have passed since we've approved your return, please contact us at _sales@feathersui.com_.
