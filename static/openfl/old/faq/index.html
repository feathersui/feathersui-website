          Feathers UI is an open source, cross-platform library of user
          interface components for creative projects. It is especially
          well-suited for games, interactive visualizations, and other rich,
          multimedia experiences. With Feathers, you can create apps for a wide
          range of devices, including phones, tablets and desktop computers.

        <p>
          The new version of Feathers UI will be built using the
          <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe programming language</a> and
          <a href="https://openfl.org/">OpenFL</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feathers UI was originally developed using the ActionScript 3
          programming language with the Adobe AIR runtime and
          <a href="https://gamua.com/starling/">Starling</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="open-source">
          Will the new Haxe/OpenFL version of Feathers UI be open source
          too?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#open-source">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Yes! Feathers UI will use the same MIT license as OpenFL.</p>

        <p>
          The source code is available now
          <a href="https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-openfl">on Github</a
          >! This project is still in the early stages of development, and it
          should be considered unstable. It's probably best to avoid using it in
          production at this time.

        </h3>
        <p>
          No. This new version of Feathers UI will be built directly on OpenFL.

          Yes. In fact, you'll gain access to more platforms. Similar to Adobe
          AIR, you can build apps for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
          Additionally, OpenFL and Haxe also give you access to web browsers (no
          plugins required) and Linux.

        <h3 id="api-differences">
          Will there be API differences in the OpenFL version of Feathers
          UI?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#api-differences">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Some components and properties will have slightly different names
          in the new OpenFL version, if the names can be made clearer or more
          concise. For example, <code>StackScreenNavigator</code> will be
          renamed <code>StackNavigator</code>. Properties like
          <code>isEnabled</code> and <code>isSelected</code> will be simplified
          to <code>enabled</code> and <code>selected</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, some existing API names would conflict with classes or
          methods in the Haxe standard library or in OpenFL. For instance, Haxe
          has a built-in data structure named <code>List</code>, so the Feathers
          UI <code>List</code> component will become <code>ListBox</code>.
          Similarly, display objects in OpenFL already have an
          <code>invalidate()</code> method, so Feathers UI components will use
          <code>setInvalid()</code> instead. In these cases, there's no choice
          but to change the name in Feathers UI to prevent collisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time that version 1.0 is released, a migration guide will be
          available to help you find any new or renamed APIs.
        </p>

        <h3 id="as3hx">
          Can I simply use
          <a href="https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/as3hx">as3hx</a> to convert
          all my existing code from ActionScript to Haxe?&nbsp;<a
            class="anchor"
            href="#as3hx"
            >#</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          An automated tool like as3hx can certainly be helpful when porting an
          existing ActionScript codebase to Haxe. It may be able to handle
          70-80% of the conversion for you. However, it's likely that you'll
          need to tweak some of the code generated by as3hx before everything
          will work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haxe and ActionScript are very similar languages, but sometimes, they
          don't behave in exactly the same way. Even if your existing app didn't
          use libraries like Starling and Feathers UI, you would probably still
          need to tweak the generated code a little bit, depending on which
          ActionScript features you were originally using.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, while OpenFL and Starling were both inspired the display
          list and event model of Adobe Flash Player, Starling's API diverges a
          bit more from the original because Starling provides more control over
          the GPU and managing textures. As a result, some APIs that you used in
          Starling may not exist or may not work exactly the same in OpenFL.
          Usually, there is a similar API that you can use instead, and
          sometimes, you can rely on the fact that OpenFL manages some things
          automatically that Starling did not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, this new version of Feathers UI will include some of its own
          API name changes. See
          <a href="#api-differences">the previous answer</a> for more details.

        <h3 id="mxml">
          Will I be able to use MXML to create my UI declaratively?&nbsp;<a
            class="anchor"
            href="#mxml"
            >#</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not at first, but it's definitely an important feature to me, and I
          want to add it as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may recall, supporting MXML with Feathers UI for Starling
          required forking the Apache Flex compiler. Haxe has a powerful,
          built-in language feature called <em>macros</em> that allows
          developers to hook into the Haxe compilation process. It should be
          possible to use macros to support a declarative file format similar to
          MXML at compile-time (without forking the Haxe compiler).
          Additionally, I'd like to look into ways to dynamically load UI using
          a declarative file format at runtime too.

          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Developers will be able to purchase premium components that aren't
          included for free in the core open source Feathers UI library. For
          example, some projects may need charts/graphs and other data
          visualization components. These types of advanced components may be
          too complex to justify the time and effort for a single developer or a
          small team to build them from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, the extra maintenance required by their complexity â€”
          along with their smaller target audience â€” makes adding them to the
          core Feathers UI open source library somewhat hard to justify.
          However, by providing an open core with premium add-ons, Feathers UI
          can offer a wider variety of components for developers who need them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, premium components make it easier for the community to
          support Feathers UI financially. To put it another way, you can
          probably convince your boss to make a purchase that helps you get your
          work done faster, but it's more difficult to get approval to donate to
          a project that anyone can download for free. These premium components
          create a source of revenue that helps to ensure ongoing development of
          the core, open source library.
