The [`TextArea`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html) class displays editable text wrapped over multiple lines that may be scrolled.

> For a single line of editable text, see the [`TextInput`](./text-input.md) component.

## The Basics

Create a [`TextArea`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html) control and add it to the [the display list](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html).

```haxe
var textArea = new TextArea();
addChild(textArea);
```

Text may be changed programatically by setting the [`text`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#text) property.

```haxe
textArea.text = "Jessica Jones";
```

[Add an event listener](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/handling-events/basics-of-handling-events.html) for [`Event.CHANGE`](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/events/Event.html#CHANGE) to perform an action when the user edits the text.

```haxe
textArea.addEventListener(Event.CHANGE, textArea_changeHandler);
```

Check for the new value of the [`text`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#text) property in the listener function.

```haxe
function textArea_changeHandler(event:Event):Void {
    var textArea = cast(event.currentTarget, TextArea);
    trace("text area change: " + textArea.text);
}
```

## States

When the user interacts with a text area using the mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen, its state will change, which may affect its appearance. For instance, the text area's background skin and font styles may be rendered differently in different states.

The [`TextInputState`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html) enum defines the states available to all text area components.

- [`ENABLED`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#ENABLED) is the text area's default state.
- [`DISABLED`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#DISABLED) is the text area's state when its [`enabled`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/core/IUIControl.html#enabled) property has been set to `false`.
- [`FOCUSED`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#FOCUSED) is the text area's state when it currently has focus.
- [`ERROR`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#ERROR) is the text area's state when an error string has been set.

## Styles

A number of styles may be customized on a [`TextArea`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html) component, including the font styles and the background skin.

### Font styles

The font styles of the text area's text may be customized by passing an [`openfl.text.TextFormat`](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/text/TextFormat.html) object to the [`textFormat`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#textFormat) property.

```haxe
textArea.textFormat = new TextFormat("Helvetica", 20, 0x3c3c3c);
```

If the text area's text should use different font styles when the text area is in different states, pass a [`TextFormat`](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/text/TextFormat.html) and state value to the [`setTextFormatForState()`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#setTextFormatForState) method.

```haxe
textArea.setTextFormatForState(TextInputState.FOCUSED, new TextFormat("Helvetica", 20, 0xcc0000));
```

Using the code above, the color of the text area's text will change when the text area receives focus, and the state changes to [`TextInputState.FOCUSED`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#FOCUSED).

When font styles aren't available for a specific state, the text area will use the default [`textFormat`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#textFormat) as a fallback.

### Background skin

Give the text area a background using the [`backgroundSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#backgroundSkin) property. The following example sets it to a [`RectangleSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/RectangleSkin.html) instance.

```haxe
var skin = new RectangleSkin();
skin.border = SolidColor(1.0, 0x999999);
skin.fill = SolidColor(0xcccccc);
skin.width = 64.0;
skin.height = 32.0;
input.backgroundSkin = skin;
```

The [`border`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/BaseGraphicsPathSkin.html#border) and [`fill`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/BaseGraphicsPathSkin.html#fill) properties of the [`RectangleSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/RectangleSkin.html) are used to adjust its appearance. They support a variety of values â€” from solid colors to gradients to bitmaps.

The text area automatically calculates its preferred size based on the initial dimensions of its background skin (accounting for some other factors too, like the dimensions of the text), so it's important to set a skin's `width` and `height` properties to appropriate values to use in this calculation.

> See [Skinning with common shapes](./shape-skins.md) for more details about how to use [`RectangleSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/RectangleSkin.html) with the [`LineStyle`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/graphics/LineStyle.html) and [`FillStyle`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/graphics/FillStyle.html) enums that change its border and fill appearance.

The appearance of the text area's border or fill may be customized to change based on the text area's current state, such as when the text area receives focus, there is an error string, or the text area is disabled. In the next example, a call to the skin's [`setFillForState()`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/RectangleSkin.html#setFillForState) method makes it switch to a different fill when the text area's [`FOCUSED`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#FOCUSED) state is active.

```haxe
skin.setFillForState(TextInputState.FOCUSED, SolidColor(0xffcccc));
```

Similarly, use the skin's [`setBorderForState()`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/RectangleSkin.html#setBorderForState) method to change the border for a specific state.

```haxe
skin.setBorderForState(TextInputState.FOCUSED, SolidColor(2.0, 0x999999));
```

In the examples above, the text area uses the same [`RectangleSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/RectangleSkin.html) for all states, and that skin listens for changes to the text area's current state. Alternatively, the text area's [`setSkinForState()`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#setSkinForState) method allows the text area to display a completely different display object when its current state changes.

```haxe
var defaultSkin = new RectangleSkin();
// ... set border, fill, width, and height
textArea.backgroundSkin = defaultSkin;

var hoverSkin = new RectangleSkin();
// ... set border, fill, width, and height
textArea.setSkinForState(TextInputState.FOCUSED, hoverSkin);
```

In the example above, the text area will have a custom skin for the [`FOCUSED`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInputState.html#FOCUSED) state, and all other states will share the default [`backgroundSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextArea.html#backgroundSkin).
