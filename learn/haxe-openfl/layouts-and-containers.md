A number of _layouts_ are available to position and size children in Feathers UI containers, and it's also possible to create [custom layouts](./custom-layouts.md).

There are two types of containers in Feathers UI, and certain layouts may be better suited for one type over the other.

- [_Simple containers_](#simple-containers) use standard [display list](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html) APIs (like [`addChild()`](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/display/DisplayObjectContainer.html#addChild) and [`removeChild()`](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/display/DisplayObjectContainer.html#removeChild)) to manage children.
- [_Data containers_](#data-containers) render children by interpreting objects that have been added to [data collections](./data-collections.md).

Every layout may be used with both container types, but data containers support special layouts that are better optimized for displaying a large number of children.

## Simple containers

Use the standard [display list](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html) APIs to add and remove children from simple containers like the ones below.

- [`LayoutGroup`](./layout-group.md)
- [`ScrollContainer`](./scroll-container.md)
- [`Panel`](./panel.md)

The following layouts are best suited for simple containers.

- [`AnchorLayout`](./anchor-layout.md)
- [`FlowRowsLayout`](./flow-rows-layout.md)
- [`HorizontalLayout`](./horizontal-layout.md)
- [`ResponsiveGridLayout`](./responsive-grid-layout.md)
- [`TiledRowsLayout`](./tiled-rows-layout.md)
- [`VerticalLayout`](./vertical-layout.md)

## Data containers

Components that render [data collections](./data-collections.md) may take advantage of special layouts that are better optimized for displaying many more children than a typical container.

- [`ListView`](./list-view.md)
- [`GridView`](./grid-view.md)
- [`GroupListView`](./group-list-view.md)
- [`TreeView`](./tree-view.md)
- [`TreeGridView`](./tree-grid-view.md)

The following layouts are optimized for data containers by providing _virtualization_ and item renderer _recycling_.

- [`HorizontalListLayout`](./horizontal-list-layout.md)
- [`TiledRowsListLayout`](./tiled-rows-list-layout.md)
- [`PagedTiledRowsListLayout`](./paged-tiled-rows-list-layout.md)
- [`VerticalListLayout`](./vertical-list-layout.md)
- [`VerticalListFixedRowLayout`](./vertical-list-fixed-row-layout.md)

## Other containers

Some containers work similarly to simple containers, where one can use the standard [display list](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html) APIs to add and remove children, but these containers have their own built-in layout and don't support custom layouts.
