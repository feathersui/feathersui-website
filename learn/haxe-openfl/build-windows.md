[Feathers UI](/) may be used to build desktop applications targeting Microsoft's Windows operating system.

## Prerequisites

In addition to the dependencies specified in the [Feathers UI installation instructions](./installation.md), building a Windows application with Feathers UI has some additional requirements.

- A computer running Microsoft Windows. Windows apps cannot be built on other operating systems, such as macOS or Linux.
- Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). The [Community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is free.

## Build

To build for the `windows` target, run the following command.

```sh
openfl build windows
```

Use the `-debug` flag to create a build to include extra debugging information, including full stack traces when there's an exception or crash.

```sh
openfl build windows -debug
```

The build's output will be written to the _bin/windows/bin_ folder.

> Your [_project.xml_ file](https://lime.openfl.org/docs/project-files/xml-format/) may optionally specify an output folder different from _bin_.
>
> ```xml
> <app path="Export"/>
> ```
>
> In the example above, the output would be generated in _Export/windows/bin_ instead.

## Run / Debug

OpenFL provides the `test` command to compile and launch your project executable on Windows.

```sh
openfl test windows
```

## Troubleshooting

## App executable crashes without exception, and a try/catch around the line where it happens has no effect when targeting C++ for Windows, macOS, or Linux

Haxe's _cpp_ target is stricter than other Haxe targets when you try to access a field or method on a `null` value. Instead of throwing an exception, a Haxe C++ app immediately crashes â€” with no way to recover, not even with [try/catch](https://haxe.org/manual/expression-try-catch.html). However, it is possible to enable a flag to force Haxe's C++ target to behave more like other targets. Add the following define to your OpenFL _project.xml_ file, and then create a new build with the `-clean` command line option (or delete your output directory before building).

```xml
<haxedef name="HXCPP_CHECK_POINTER" />
```

Using `HXCPP_CHECK_POINTER` may add some overhead that could negatively affect performance. It may be a good idea to enable it temporarily for debugging purposes, fix the issue, and then disable it again.

> Configuring OpenFL to build for native targets, like Windows or macOS, can be a little tricky! Head over to either the [Feathers UI community forum](https://community.feathersui.com/) or the [Feathers UI Discord](https://discord.feathersui.com/). Explain which command you tried to run, be sure to mention that you are targeting **windows**, and post the error message (and any additional relevant output). Ideally, we can help you figure out a solution, and then we'll also add it to this troubleshooting section, so that everyone can benefit.
