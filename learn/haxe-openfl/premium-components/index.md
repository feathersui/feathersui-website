Developers looking for capabilities that go beyond the core, open source [Feathers UI](/) library should visit the Feathers UI Store to purchase premium UI component packs with advanced, new capabilities. The following sets of premium UI components are available for purchase.

- [Barcodes Pack](./barcodes-pack.md)
- [Data Containers Pack](./data-containers-pack.md)
- [Text Inputs Pack](./text-inputs-pack.md)

All premium UI components for Feathers UI include:

- Complete _.hx_ source code
- An HTML API reference
- One or more sample projects

There are two ways to install each library:

1. Copy the _.hx_ source code files directly into your project.
2. Run **`haxelib install [library-name]-haxelib.zip`**, and add `<haxelib name="[library-name]"/>` to your OpenFL _project.xml_. (Replace _\[library-name\]_ with the actual name of the library)
