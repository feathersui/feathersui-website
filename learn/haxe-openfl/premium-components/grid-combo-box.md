The [`GridComboBox`](https://api.feathersui.com/premium-components/data-containers-pack/com/feathersui/controls/GridComboBox.html) class displays an editable [text input](../text-input.md) and a [button](../button.md), that when triggered, renders the items from a [data collection](../data-collections.md) in a pop-up [grid view](../grid-view.md).

> ⚠️ **Beta Notice**: This component is still quite new. Some APIs may go through minor changes in upcoming releases.
