The [Feathers UI](/) framework includes a number of built-in skin classes that draw common shapes like rectangles, circles, ellipses, and more â€” with properties available to customize how both the border and fill are rendered.

If a design needs something more complex, developers can create completely custom programmatic skins to draw their own graphics.
