## Removed APIs that were deprecated in Feathers 3

A number of APIs were deprecated in Feathers 3. See the [Feathers 3.0 Migration Guide](./migration-guide-3.0.md) and the [Feathers 3.3 Migration Guide](./migration-guide-3.3.md) for complete details, including a number of regular expressions that you can use with Find/Replace in your IDE to ease migration away from some of the old constants.

## Themes and `AssetManager`

Feathers example themes that use [Starling's Asset Manager](http://manual.starling-framework.org/en/#_asset_management) have been upgraded to the new [`starling.assets.AssetManager`](http://doc.starling-framework.org/current/starling/assets/AssetManager.html) class that was added in Starling v2.4.

The new `AssetManager` handles errors differently, so the example themes now dispatch a different set of events. In previous versions, the themes dispatched separate `Event.PARSE_ERROR`, `Event.SECURITY_ERROR` and `Event.IO_ERROR` events. Starting in Feathers 4.0, the example themes dispatch a generic `FeathersEventType.ERROR` event for all event types. This change is required because the new `AssetManager` no longer differentiates between different types of errors.

An example event listener for `FeathersEventType.ERROR` appears below:

```actionscript
theme.addEventListener(FeathersEventType.ERROR, function(event:Event, error:String):void
{
	trace("AssetManager error:", error);
});
```

The `Event.COMPLETE` event dispatched by the example themes has not changed.

## `TextArea` inner padding

The [`TextArea`](./text-area.md) component now supports a prompt, similar to the `TextInput` component. In order to position the prompt relative to the text inside the view port, a new `innerPadding` style has been created (with `innerPaddingTop`, `innerPaddingRight`, `innerPaddingBottom`, and `innerPaddingLeft` styles to allow inner padding on each individual side to be customized). This inner padding is used to position the prompt, and it is also passed down to the `ITextEditorViewPort` component to position its text.

Previously, you might have set `padding`, `paddingTop`, `paddingRight`, `paddingBottom`, or `paddingLeft` on a `TextFieldTextEditorViewPort` component to add some padding around the text. This will no longer work because the `TextArea` will pass its inner padding values down to the view port and your values will be overridden. Instead, you should set the inner padding values on the `TextArea`, and they will be passed down to the view port automatically. This is considered a breaking change.
