Whether you're using the latest unstable version of Feathers or you've made changes to the core Feathers library, you may want to build the Feathers SWC locally.

## Requirements

- [Feathers source code from Github](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers) (the main build target does **not** use the Flex SDK)

- [Starling Framework source code from Github](https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework)

- [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

- [Adobe AIR SDK with Compiler](http://www.adobe.com/go/air_sdk)

## Build Instructions

The main build script is `build.xml`, located in the root of the source tree. This file is only available if you download the full project source code for [Feathers on Github](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers). The build script is **not** included in the ZIP file that is downloadable from the [Feathers website](https://feathersui.com/).

Two other files in the same directory, `build.properties` and `sdk.properties`, set up the environment for the build script. If you need to override any properties from these files, you can create new files named `build.local.properties` and `sdk.local.properties`. The build script will automatically detect if these files are present and use their values instead of the defaults.

1. Create a file named `sdk.local.properties` in the same directory as `build.xml`. Inside, override the `airsdk.root` property to point to the location of your local AIR SDK with ASC 2.0:

```code
airsdk.root = C:/Development/AIR_SDK
```

Use the path on your local computer rather than the one above. The path above is for a location on Windows, but paths on Macs are supported too. Make sure that you use forward slashes, regardless of which platform you're on.

2. build.properties creates a property named `starling.root` that points to `third-party/starling`. From the Starling Framework, copy the contents of `starling/src` into this directory.

Alternatively, you may create a `build.local.properties` file and override the value of `starling.root`.

3. Open a command prompt in the directory where build.xml is located.

4. Run the command `ant swc`.

5. `feathers.swc` will be compiled and placed in an directory named `output`.

Most likely, you will only need the `swc` target, which simply builds the SWC and does nothing else. There are several targets available that you may find useful.

- `swc` compiles the Feathers SWC.

- `api` generates the Feathers API documentation.

- `help` generates the Feathers Help files from Markdown.

- `test` runs the Feathers unit tests.

- `full` compiles the SWC, generates the API documentation, and copies all of the supporting files into the `output` directory to create a full release build of Feathers.

- `package` creates a full release build of Feathers, and then it packages everything into a ZIP file.
