The [`LayoutGroup`](/api-reference/feathers/controls/LayoutGroup.html) class provides a generic container for layout, without scrolling. By default, you can position children manually, but you can also pass in a layout implementation, like [`HorizontalLayout`](./horizontal-layout.md) or [`VerticalLayout`](./vertical-layout.md) to position the children automatically.

> If you need scrolling, you should use the [`ScrollContainer`](./scroll-container.md) component instead.

## The Basics

First, let's create a `LayoutGroup` container and add it to the display list:

```actionscript
var group:LayoutGroup = new LayoutGroup();
this.addChild( group );
```

A `LayoutGroup` works a lot like any [`DisplayObjectContainer`](https://doc.starling-framework.org/core/starling/display/DisplayObjectContainer.html), so you can use the standard `addChild()`, `removeChild()` and other display list manipulation functions.

```actionscript
var xPosition:Number = 0;
for(var i:int = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    var quad:Quad = new Quad( 100, 100, 0xff0000 );
    quad.x = xPosition;
    group.addChild( quad );
    xPosition += quad.width + 10;
}
```

The children of a `LayoutGroup` do not need to be Feathers UI controls. As you can see above, we've added some Starling [`Quad`](https://doc.starling-framework.org/core/starling/display/Quad.html) instances.

By default, the `LayoutGroup` will automatically resize itself to fit the area that the children occupy. We can set the width and height manually, if desired, to override this behavior:

```actionscript
group.width = 200;
group.height = 200;
```

You'll notice that the children are still visible. By default, clipping is disabled on `LayoutGroup` to maximize rendering performance. Set the [`clipContent`](/api-reference/feathers/controls/LayoutGroup.html#clipContent) property to `true` to enable clipping, if desired.

## Layout

We manually positioned the quads in the example code above. Instead, let's pass a [`HorizontalLayout`](/api-reference/feathers/layout/HorizontalLayout.html) to the [`layout`](/api-reference/feathers/controls/LayoutGroup.html#layout) property of the `LayoutGroup`. This layout will calculate the positioning of children for us automatically:

```actionscript
var layout:HorizontalLayout = new HorizontalLayout();
layout.gap = 10;
group.layout = layout;
```

Here, we've set the [`gap`](/api-reference/feathers/layout/HorizontalLayout.html#gap) property, but `HorizontalLayout` provides many more useful features. See [How to use `HorizontalLayout` with Feathers containers](./horizontal-layout.md) for complete details.

> Feathers comes with a number of different [layouts](/api-reference/feathers/layout/package-detail.html), in addition to `HorizontalLayout`.

## Skinning a `LayoutGroup`

The `LayoutGroup` control are mainly the background skins. For full details about which properties are available, see the [`LayoutGroup` API reference](/api-reference/feathers/controls/LayoutGroup.html). We'll look at a few of the most common ways of styling a `LayoutGroup` below.

### Background skins

We can give the `LayoutGroup` a background skin that stretches to fill the entire width and height of the group. In the following example, we pass in a `starling.display.Image`, but the skin may be any Starling display object:

```actionscript
var skin:Image = new Image( texture );
skin.scale9Grid = new Rectangle( 2, 2, 1, 6 );
group.backgroundSkin = skin;
```

It's as simple as setting the [`backgroundSkin`](/api-reference/feathers/controls/LayoutGroup.html#backgroundSkin) property.

We can give the `LayoutGroup` a different background when it is disabled:

```actionscript
var skin:Image = new Image( texture );
skin.scale9Grid = new Rectangle( 1, 3, 2, 6 );
group.backgroundDisabledSkin = skin;
```

The [`backgroundDisabledSkin`](/api-reference/feathers/controls/LayoutGroup.html#backgroundDisabledSkin) is displayed when the group is disabled. If the `backgroundDisabledSkin` isn't provided to a disabled group, it will fall back to using the `backgroundSkin` in the disabled state.
