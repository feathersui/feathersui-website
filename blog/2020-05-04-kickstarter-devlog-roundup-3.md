Every three to four weeks, I've been posting [updates on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl/posts) that summarize what I've been adding to the [Haxe/OpenFL version of Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/openfl/) recently. To be sure that no one has missed any of these updates, I'm going to occasionally post a quick roundup here on the Feathers UI blog. Let's jump right inâ€¦

The [user guide](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/) and [API reference](https://api.feathersui.com/) were ready for the preview build, the [`StackNavigator`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/stack-navigator) component was updated to allow passing data between views, and an all new [`RouterNavigator`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/router-navigator) component was introduced for the first time.

- [2020-03-19: AnchorLayoutData relative-to-child, GridView, 7GUIs, and experimental compile-time XML layouts](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl/posts/2789779) summarizes some updates to [`AnchorLayout`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/anchor-layout) and [`GridView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/grid-view), it introduces some new [7GUIs samples](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-7guis), and it also introduces the [experimental feathersui-xml project](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-xml) that creates an MXML-like dialect.

- [2020-04-15: TreeView, optimized virtual layouts in ListView, GridView progress, PageIndicator, PageNavigator, TabNavigator](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl/posts/2812073) is a big updates with a lot of new components, including [`TabNavigator`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/tab-navigator), [`PageNavigator`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/page-navigator), [`PageIndicator`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/page-indicator), and [`TreeView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/tree-view). It also mentions some optimizations to [`ListView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/list-view) with support for _virtualized_ layouts that recycle item renderers during scrolling.

Every few months, I'll try to do another roundup of the Kickstarter updates here on the blog.
