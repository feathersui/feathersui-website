Today, Feathers UI **beta.3** is now officially available [on Haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/p/feathersui). This is the latest of multiple preview builds that are planned before the first stable release in early 2022. Since we're in the _beta_ stage, the core framework architecture has settled down, and breaking changes are much less likely to happen. Developers who don't mind a few rough edges here and there should consider Feathers UI ready for starting development on new projects!

[Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) is an open source framework of [user interface components](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/ui-components) for creative, [cross-platform](https://feathersui.com/cross-platform-guis/) projects. Using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language, Feathers UI is built on [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) â€” a user-friendly library for rendering, input, networking, and more. Deploy native apps to iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux (and even publish your project to the web!) using the same Haxe codebase.

> ðŸš¨ Please note that this is a **beta** version of Feathers UI. Some components and features may still be missing, and occasional bugs should be expected.

Feathers UI has reached this milestone thanks the very generous support of all of the backers from the [Feathers UI Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl), which completed successfully in the summer of 2019. A big, enthusastic thank you to everyone who has supported the project, whether you are a backer, shared the Kickstarter with your friends on social media, or simply encouraged me ([Josh](https://twitter.com/joshtynjala)) to keep up the good work!

## What's new in beta.3?

Let's take a look at some of the new UI components and features that are included with Feathers UI beta.3

### New UI Components

- [`Alert`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/alert/) displays a message in a modal pop-up dialog with a title and a set of buttons.

- [`ButtonBar`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/button-bar/) displays a grouping of buttons based on a [data collection](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/data-collections).

- [`Form`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/form/) and [`FormItem`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/FormItem.html) display a set of form controls with labels, including the ability to assign a specific submit button.

### A big release

This build also includes a ton of minor improvements. Here's a few worth highlighting:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/img/beta-3-feathersui-grid-view-horizontal-scrolling.png" style="width:450px"/></div>

- Support for horizontal scrolling in the [`GridView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/grid-view/) component when the content width exceeds the container width.
- Separate [`branchIcon`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/dataRenderers/HierarchicalItemRenderer.html#branchIcon), [`branchOpenIcon`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/dataRenderers/HierarchicalItemRenderer.html#branchOpenIcon), [`branchClosedIcon`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/dataRenderers/HierarchicalItemRenderer.html#branchClosedIcon), and [`leafIcon`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/dataRenderers/HierarchicalItemRenderer.html#leafIcon) styles on the [`TreeViewItemRenderer`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/dataRenderers/HierarchicalItemRenderer.html) component.
- A [`maxChars`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/TextInput.html#maxChars) property for [`TextInput`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/text-input/) and [`TextArea`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/text-area/).
- A new `setPadding()` convenience method was added to all classes with `paddingTop`, `paddingRight`, `paddingBottom` and `paddingLeft` properties. It sets all four value at once.
- A new [`Application.topLevelApplication`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/controls/Application.html#topLevelApplication) static property that makes it easy to access the root Feathers UI application object.
- [`ArrayHierarchicalCollection`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/data/ArrayHierarchicalCollection.html) is a new implementation of [`IHierarchicalCollection`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/data/IHierarchicalCollection.html) that's a bit more flexible than the existing [`TreeCollection`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/data/TreeCollection.html).
- New [`filterFunction`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/data/IHierarchicalCollection.html#filterFunction) and [`sortCompareFunction`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/data/IHierarchicalCollection.html#sortCompareFunction) properties on [`IHierarchicalCollection`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/data/IHierarchicalCollection.html) to match the same properties on `IFlatCollection`.
