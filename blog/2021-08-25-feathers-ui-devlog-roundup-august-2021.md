Every three to four weeks, I've been posting [updates on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl/posts) that summarize what I've been adding to the [Haxe/OpenFL version of Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/openfl/) recently. To be sure that no one has missed any of these updates, I'm going to occasionally post a quick roundup here on the Feathers UI blog. Let's jump right inâ€¦

- [2021-05-21: NumericStepper, app scaling, item renderer accessories, TextInput errorString](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl/posts/3196384) introduces the new [`NumericStepper`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/numeric-stepper/) component, the [`IScaleManager`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/core/IScaleManager.html) interface to customize how the [`Application`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/application/) component scales. Item renderers may now display an "accessory" view on the right side, and the [`TextInput`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/text-input/) component may display an `errorString` on focus, with a customizable error background skin.
