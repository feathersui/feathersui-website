Today, Feathers UI **beta.1** is now officially available [on Haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/p/feathersui). This is the latest of multiple preview builds that are planned before the first stable release in early 2022. We've now made it past the _alpha_ stage, which means that the core framework architecture has settled down, and breaking changes are much less likely to happen. Developers who don't mind a few rough edges here and there should consider Feathers UI ready for starting development on new projects!

[Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) is an open source framework of [user interface components](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/ui-components) for creative, [cross-platform](https://feathersui.com/cross-platform-guis/) projects. Using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language, Feathers UI is built on [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) â€” a user-friendly library for rendering, input, networking, and more. Deploy native apps to iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux (and even publish your project to the web!) using the same Haxe codebase.

> ðŸš¨ Please note that this is a **beta** version of Feathers UI. Some components and features may still be missing, and occasional bugs should be expected.

Feathers UI has reached this milestone thanks the very generous support of all of the backers from the [Feathers UI Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl), which completed successfully in the summer of 2019. A big, enthusastic thank you to everyone who has supported the project, whether you are a backer, shared the Kickstarter with your friends on social media, or simply encouraged me ([Josh](https://twitter.com/joshtynjala)) to keep up the good work!

## What's new in beta.1?

Let's take a look at some of the new UI components and features that are included with Feathers UI beta.1.

### New UI Components

- [`Drawer`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/drawer) is a container that adds a special drawer that slides in and out, above all other content. It may be opened or closed with a swipe gesture from one of the four edges. ([Live Demo](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/components-explorer/drawer))

  <div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/drawer"><img src="/blog/img/beta-1-feathersui-drawer.png" style="width:450px"/></a></div>

- [`HDividedBox` and `VDividedBox`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/divided-box) are containers display dividers between each of their children, and the dividers may be dragged to resize the children. ([Live Demo 1](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/components-explorer/horizontal-divided-box) and [Live Demo 2](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/components-explorer/vertical-divided-box))

  <div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/divided-box"><img src="/blog/img/beta-1-feathersui-horizontal-divided-box.png" style="width:450px"/></a></div>

- [`LayoutGroupItemRenderer`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/layout-group-item-renderer) is a base class for creating custom item renderers to display in data containers, such as [`ListView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/list-view) and [`GridView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/grid-view). This class allows item renderers with any number of children added to a layout (like [`LayoutGroup`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/layout-group)), and it also supports skinning based on mouse/touch states (like [`ItemRenderer`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/item-renderer)).

### New Samples

This build includes three new samples that demonstrate how to create custom skins for Feathers UI components.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/custom-programmatic-skin"><img src="/blog/img/beta-1-feathersui-custom-programmatic-skin-sample.png" style="width:400px"/></a></div>

The [custom-programmatic-skin sample](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/custom-programmatic-skin) demonstrates how to create a custom skin with your own drawing commands. [Source Code on Github](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-openfl/tree/v1.0.0-beta.1/samples/custom-programmatic-skin/)

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/custom-programmatic-skin-with-states"><img src="/blog/img/beta-1-feathersui-custom-programmatic-skin-with-states-sample.png" style="width:400px"/></a></div>

The [custom-programmatic-skin-with-states sample](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/custom-programmatic-skin-with-states) creates a custom skin for a [`Button`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/button) component that changes appearance when the button's state changes. [Source Code on Github](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-openfl/tree/v1.0.0-beta.1/samples/custom-programmatic-skin-with-states/)

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/animated-tween-skin"><img src="/blog/img/beta-1-feathersui-animated-tween-skin-sample.png" style="width:400px"/></a></div>

The [animated-tween-skin sample](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/animated-tween-skin) creates a custom skin that triggers animations based on mouse/touch events. [Source Code on Github](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-openfl/tree/v1.0.0-beta.1/samples/animated-tween-skin/)

## A big release

This build also includes a ton of minor improvements. Here's a few worth highlighting:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/img/beta-1-feathersui-grid-view-resizable-columns.png" style="width:450px"/></div>

- Drag-and-drop column resizing in the [`GridView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/grid-view) component
- Multiple selection in the [`ListView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/list-view) and [`GridView`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/grid-view) components
- A new [`ResponsiveGridLayout`](https://api.feathersui.com/v1.0.0-beta.1/feathers/layout/ResponsiveGridLayout.html) class
- New shape skins ([`TriangleSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/v1.0.0-beta.1/feathers/skins/TriangleSkin.html), [`PillSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/v1.0.0-beta.1/feathers/skins/PillSkin.html), and [`TabSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/v1.0.0-beta.1/feathers/skins/TabSkin.html))
