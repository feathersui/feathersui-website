Today, Feathers UI **v1.0.0-rc.2** is now officially available [on Haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/p/feathersui). If all goes well, the stable 1.0 release should happen in July. The current plan is to wait until updates for both [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) and [Lime](https://lime.openfl.org), both major dependencies, are released.

If you're not aware, [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) is an [open source](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-openfl) framework of [graphical user interface (GUI) components](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/ui-components) for creative, [cross-platform](https://feathersui.com/cross-platform-guis/) projects. Using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language, Feathers UI is built on [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/), a user-friendly library for rendering, input, networking, and more. Deploy native apps to iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linuxâ€¦ and even publish your project to the web â€” all using the same Haxe codebase.

> ðŸŽ‰ Please note that this is a **release candidate** version of Feathers UI. It should be considered ready for production use.

Feathers UI continues to achieve each new milestone thanks the very generous support from the contributors on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshtynjala), and everyone who backed the successful [2019 Feathers UI Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl). A big, enthusastic thank you to you all!
