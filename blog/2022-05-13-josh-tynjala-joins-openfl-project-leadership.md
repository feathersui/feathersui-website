Recently, Joshua Granick, long-time leader of the [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) project, asked Josh Tynjala of [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) and Chris Speciale of [Dimensionscape](https://dimensionscape.com) to join him in forming a new [OpenFL Board of Directors](https://community.openfl.org/t/administrative-organization-changes/13460). OpenFL is a critical dependency of Feathers UI, and Josh Tynjala has been contributing code to the open source project for a couple of years now. In this expanded role, Josh is excited to collaborate more with his fellow board members, and other active OpenFL contributors, in a number of ways:

- Create more frequent OpenFL and Lime releases.
- Increase automated testing, for more coverage across a larger set of target platforms.
- Engage more with the OpenFL developer community. In particular:
  - Provide faster feedback on issues and pull requests.
  - Invite new committers that have a track record of high quality pull requests.
- Expand documentation — especially for beginners who don't have a history of working with Adobe Flash.

There's a lot to look forward to in the future for both OpenFL and Feathers UI. Stay tuned in the coming months for some big releases… and maybe a few surprises.

For more details, please see official OpenFL announcement titled [Administrative Organization Changes](https://community.openfl.org/t/administrative-organization-changes/13460), posted by Chris Speciale on the OpenFL community forum.
